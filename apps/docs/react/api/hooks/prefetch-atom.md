# prefetchAtom

Evaluates an already-created `AsyncResult` atom and resolves with its successful value.

## Import

```ts
import { prefetchAtom } from "@ensforge/react";
```

## Usage

```ts
const value = await prefetchAtom(registry, atom, signal);
```

## Parameters

Accepts an Effect Atom registry, an `AsyncResult` atom, and an optional `AbortSignal`.

## Return Type

`Promise<Success>`

Use [`prefetch`](/react/api/cache/prefetch) when you have an atom factory and action parameters rather
than an existing atom instance.
