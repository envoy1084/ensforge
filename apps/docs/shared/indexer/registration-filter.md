`RegistrationFilter | undefined`

Narrows registrations by `registrant`, `protocols`, or expiry bounds. The general registration feed
does not accept exact-name or registration-time filters because the deployed schemas cannot apply
those constraints consistently on the server. Use `getRegistrationHistory` for one name.
