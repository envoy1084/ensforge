This operation depends on the ENSv2 indexer and returns a discriminated union:

- `{ status: "supported", value }` when a V2 indexer is configured and available.
- `{ status: "unsupported", network, reason }` when V2 discovery is disabled or unavailable.

Check `status` before reading `value`. An unavailable V2 source is represented as data rather than
an exception so applications can keep supporting networks that only expose ENSv1 indexing.
