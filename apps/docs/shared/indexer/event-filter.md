`EventFilter | undefined`

Narrows events by `name`, `namehash`, `protocols`, semantic `kinds`, `contractAddress`, block range,
or timestamp range. Bounds are inclusive. Some ENSv2 semantic event kinds require a name anchor;
unsupported combinations fail with `IndexerFilterError` before querying the endpoint.
