### pageSize

`number | undefined`

Maximum number of items to return. It must be greater than zero and cannot exceed the
`maximumPageSize` configured for the indexer. The default is the smaller of `20` and the configured
maximum.

### cursor

`IndexerCursor | undefined`

Opaque cursor returned by the previous page. Pass it unchanged to continue the same query. A cursor
is tied to its filters, ordering, network, and enabled indexer sources; changing any of them requires
starting again without a cursor.
