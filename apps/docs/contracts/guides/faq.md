# FAQ

## Should I import a complete ABI or a fragment?

Use a fragment for one focused call. Use a complete ABI for broad contract access or event tooling.

## Are deployment objects live lookups?

No. They are versioned package data with provenance. Upgrade the package to receive new deployments.

## Can I use the contracts package without Effect?

Yes. It contains plain immutable TypeScript values and depends only on viem types and ABI utilities.

## Do resolver profiles resolve names?

No. They are ABI definitions. Use `@ensforge/core` for resolver discovery and CCIP Read.

## Are HCA contracts stable?

No. They are exported from an explicitly experimental entrypoint and may change independently of
the stable V2 surface.
