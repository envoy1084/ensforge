## Exports

| Export                           | Description                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lockedMigrationControllerV2Abi` | Immutable ABI value with viem-compatible literal types. |

## Entrypoint

`@ensforge/contracts/v2`

The values are immutable and can be passed directly to viem contract, log, and encoding utilities.

## When to use

Use the complete ABI when one integration needs several unrelated functions or event families from this contract. For a single SDK action, prefer the corresponding focused fragment to minimize bundled ABI data.

## Type Safety

Exports retain literal TypeScript types, so viem can infer valid function names, arguments, return values, and event fields without a manual cast.

```ts
type Export = typeof lockedMigrationControllerV2Abi;
```
